# FortiAnalyzer Dataset Skill for Claude Code

A [Claude Code skill](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) that writes **FortiAnalyzer dataset queries** (FAZ SQL) for **Reports > Datasets** in the FAZ GUI. Describe the report you want, and you get a query you can paste straight in.

```
/faz-dataset Top IPS victims
```

```sql
SELECT victim, sum(totalnum) AS totalnum
FROM ###(
    SELECT (CASE WHEN direction='incoming' THEN ipstr(dstip) ELSE ipstr(srcip) END) AS source,
           (CASE WHEN direction='incoming' THEN ipstr(srcip) ELSE ipstr(dstip) END) AS victim,
           count(*) AS totalnum
    FROM $log-attack
    WHERE $filter
    GROUP BY source, victim
    /*SkipSTART*/ORDER BY totalnum DESC/*SkipEND*/
)### t
WHERE victim IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY victim
ORDER BY totalnum DESC
```

Claude also explains the non-obvious parts. Here, that's why `direction` decides which IP is the victim, and why the `${THREAT_*}` macros are written out inline: they don't expand in custom datasets.

## Tested on a live FortiAnalyzer 7.6

Every rule in this skill was checked by running queries on a real FAZ 7.6 under Reports > Datasets. Anything that failed was fixed and re-tested:

- **Generated queries:** top IPS victims, sessions per subnet by application, malicious websites with source IPs, and failed admin logins per device over time all ran correctly.
- **Reference patterns:** every core pattern the skill copies from (Top-N, hcache, bandwidth, time series, IPS block rate, attacker/victim) has been run. The one broken pattern was fixed and re-tested.
- **Columns:** real column lists were dumped for traffic, event, webfilter, attack, virus, app-ctrl, dns, dlp, file-filter and ssl. Documented columns that don't exist were confirmed with direct SELECTs.
- **Macros:**
  - These expand in custom datasets: `${REPORT_SESSION}`, `${REPORT_SESSION_WITH_LONGLIVE}`, `${BLOCKED_ACTION}`.
  - These fail, so the skill writes them out inline: `${USER}`, `${THREAT_*}`, `${LEVEL2SEVID}`.
- **Version-specific quirks** that the skill knows about:
  - On 7.6, `utmevent` is empty in traffic logs. Use `countips > 0` and the other `count*` columns instead.
  - SSL logs use `tlsver`/`cipher`, not `sslversion`/`sslcipher`.

Where FAZ 7.6 and FAZ 8.0 differ, the column files list both sets and label each one. Anything not yet tested is marked as unverified.

## Supported log types

| Log type | Log source | Column file |
|---|---|---|
| Traffic | `$log-traffic` | `cols-tlog.md` |
| Event | `$log-event` | `cols-elog.md` |
| Web Filter | `$log-webfilter` | `cols-wlog.md` |
| App Control | `$log-app-ctrl` | `cols-alog.md` |
| Antivirus | `$log-virus` | `cols-vlog.md` |
| IPS / Attack | `$log-attack` | `cols-slog.md` |
| DNS Filter | `$log-dns` | `cols-dlog.md` |
| DLP | `$log-dlp` | `cols-dlp.md` |
| Email Filter | `$log-emailfilter` | `cols-emailfilter.md` |
| File Filter | `$log-file-filter` | `cols-file-filter.md` |
| FortiClient Event / Traffic | `$log-fct-event` / `$log-fct-traffic` | `cols-fct-event.md` / `cols-tlog.md` |
| SSL, SSH, WAF, Network Scan, Security, GTP, Content, VoIP, Protocol, SIEM, Anomaly, ICAP, Virtual Patch | `$log-<type>` | `cols-<type>.md` |

It also covers the ADOM reference tables, the SOC tables (`$event`, `$incident`), and the `fv_*` materialized views.

## Installation

Clone the repo and copy the `faz-dataset/` directory into your Claude Code skills folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/sanderzegers/fortianalyzer-dataset-skill.git
cp -r fortianalyzer-dataset-skill/faz-dataset ~/.claude/skills/
```

Claude Code detects `SKILL.md` and registers the skill automatically.

## Usage

In any Claude Code session, describe what you want:

```
/faz-dataset show top 10 sources by bytes for FortiGate traffic logs
```

Or ask a FAZ dataset question, and the skill triggers automatically.

## Key conventions enforced

- `FROM $log-<type>`, never a hardcoded table name
- `WHERE $filter` for the mandatory time and device scope
- `bitAnd(logflag,1)>0` for sessions, `bitAnd(logflag,bitOr(1,32))>0` for bandwidth
- `coalesce(sentdelta,sentbyte,0)` for bytes. Summing `sentbyte` alone overcounts long-lived sessions (about 1,600× in testing)
- `###(subquery)###` hcache with `/*SkipSTART*/ORDER BY.../*SkipEND*/`. The outer query only re-aggregates columns the hcache returns
- `ipstr()` for IPs, `nullifna()` for `user`/`app` fields
- `${...}` macros only where confirmed working; everything else is written out inline
- FAZ helpers in snake_case (`regexp_replace`, `ip_subnet`), and ClickHouse functions such as `isIPAddressInRange()` where tested

## Documentation

The repo also includes a detailed guide to writing FortiAnalyzer dataset queries. It isn't specific to the Claude skill, but it's useful for understanding how FAZ SQL works:

**[FortiAnalyzer Dataset Query Writing Guide](faz-dataset-query-guide.md)**

Topics covered: query structure, execution model, macros, hcache, performance, and practical patterns.
