## 1. Architecture Overview

Dataset queries are written in a FAZ-extended SQL dialect. They are **not** sent directly to ClickHouse. The full pipeline is:

```
Browser
  └─► Apache httpd (faz-gui-proj)
        └─► Django backend  (/usr/local/lib/python3.11/proj/)
              ├── 1. Template expansion  (fazsqltool.py — FazReportSQL.parseFazKeyword)
              │       $log-*, $filter, ${MACRO}, ###...### hcache
              ├── 2. SQL dialect rewrite  (sql_rewriter service — port 5000)
              │       FAZ SQL dialect → valid ClickHouse SQL
              └── 3. Query execution
                      ClickHouse (logs) + PostgreSQL (identity/SIEM, via CH proxy tables)
```

### Component breakdown

**Apache httpd (`faz-gui-proj`)**

The web server. Runs as `apache` user with a custom Fortinet module (`fmg_request.so`) loaded alongside standard Apache modules. Two backends are configured:

- `/jsonrpc` — handled directly by the compiled `fmg_request.so` C module. This is the FortiManager-style JSON-RPC API used for device management operations.
- `/p/...` — all GUI application requests (log queries, reports, SIEM, etc.) are routed via `mod_wsgi` to the Django backend process.
- `/flatui/...` and `/cgi-bin/module/flatui*` — proxied via FastCGI (Unix socket `/tmp/fmgd.domain`) to `fmgd`, the lower-level FortiManager daemon handling device config and provisioning.

**Django backend (`faz-gui-proj` wsgi process)**

The main FAZ application, written in Python/Django, running at `/usr/local/lib/python3.11/proj/`. It is the "FAZ Query Engine" — the component that understands report context (which ADOM, which devices, which time range) and orchestrates query execution. Key Django apps:

- `logview/` — log search and dataset queries (the `logsearch/run/`, `dataset/sql/fetch/` endpoints)
- `report/` — report scheduling and rendering
- `alert/` — SIEM alert management
- `incident/` — SIEM incident management
- `siem/` — SIEM parser and event collector config
- `fortisoc/`, `fortiview/`, `fabric/` — SOC, FortiView, and Fabric features

The Django backend performs **step 1 (template expansion)** and then calls the sql_rewriter service for **step 2**.

**`fazsqltool.py` (`/usr/local/python/sql_rewriter/fazsqltool.py`, 144 KB)**

A Python library (not directly executable) that does two distinct jobs:

1. **Template variable expansion** — the `FazReportSQL` class and its `parseFazKeyword()` method expand all FAZ-specific variables before the SQL is sent anywhere:
   - `$log-traffic` → the actual ClickHouse view name scoped to the current ADOM/device (e.g. `sp1_FGT_tlog`)
   - `$filter` → a concrete ClickHouse WHERE clause with the report time range and device filter
   - `${MACRO}` → expands named macros like `${REPORT_SESSION}` → `(bitAnd(logflag,1)>0)`
   - `$ADOM_ENDPOINT` → `faz_fabric_endpoints`, `$ADOM_ENDUSER` → `faz_fabric_endusers`, etc.
   - `###(subquery)###` → triggers the hcache mechanism (see §5)

2. **SQL dialect conversion** — the `FazSQLConvertor` and `FazFabricSQLConvertor` classes convert the FAZ SQL dialect (after variable expansion) into valid ClickHouse SQL. This handles FAZ-specific syntax that ClickHouse does not understand natively, such as FAZ aggregate functions, the `/*fabricStart*/`/`/*fabricEnd*/` hint, and `/*SkipSTART*/`/`/*SkipEND*/` hints.

The parser is built on a custom **ANTLR4 grammar** (`parser/FazsqlLexer.py` 207 KB, `parser/FazsqlParser.py` 327 KB) that defines the full FAZ SQL dialect.

**sql_rewriter Flask service (`/usr/local/python/sql_rewriter/app.py`, port 5000)**

A lightweight Flask JSON-RPC service wrapping `fazsqltool.py`. It runs as a gunicorn process (master + worker) on `localhost:5000` and is only reachable from within the FAZ itself. The Django backend calls it during query processing.

Exposed methods:
- `sqlrewriter.rewrite` — converts a FAZ SQL string (after template expansion) to ClickHouse SQL. The `skip_fabric` parameter optionally neutralizes `/*fabricStart*/`/`/*fabricEnd*/` hints.
- `sqlrewriter.fabricrewrite` — variant for fabric-wide queries using `FazFabricSQLConvertor`.
- `sqlrewriter.logfields` — extracts the list of log fields referenced in a query, used by the GUI to determine column display.

**ClickHouse (port 9000 native / 8123 HTTP, localhost only)**

The query execution engine for all log data. The Django backend sends the final rewritten SQL here. The `siem` database contains:
- Raw log tables (`tlog_sp1`, `elog_sp1`, etc.) — MergeTree, append-only, columnar
- Log views (`sp1_FGT_tlog`, etc.) — filters raw tables by `_devlogtype` for each device type
- Materialized views (`fv_*`) — pre-aggregated AggregatingMergeTree tables
- PostgreSQL proxy tables — ClickHouse table definitions using the `PostgreSQL()` engine that forward reads to PostgreSQL at query time (this is how log JOINs to identity data work)

**PostgreSQL (port 5432, localhost only)**

Stores everything that is not raw log data: identity, SIEM events, device registry, policy, risk scores, and query cache. See the Data Storage section below for the full breakdown.

### Step-by-step: what happens when a dataset query runs

1. The GUI sends the dataset SQL (with all FAZ variables intact) to `POST /p/logview/dataset/sql/fetch/` on the Django backend.
2. Django looks up the report context: current ADOM OID, selected devices, time range start/end.
3. Django calls `FazReportSQL.parseFazKeyword()` (in `fazsqltool.py`) to expand all template variables. After this step the SQL contains only ClickHouse-compatible table names and filter expressions, except it is still in FAZ SQL dialect.
4. For any `###(subquery)###` blocks, Django computes a hash of the subquery text. It checks the PostgreSQL hcache tables (`{DEV}-hcache_query/ref/res`) for a cached result. On a cache miss it executes the subquery in ClickHouse and stores the result in the hcache tables. The `###...###` wrapper is replaced with a reference to the cached result table.
5. Django calls `sqlrewriter.rewrite` on the sql_rewriter service (port 5000), passing the template-expanded SQL. The service uses `FazSQLConvertor` (ANTLR4 parser + rewriter) to produce valid ClickHouse SQL.
6. Django sends the final ClickHouse SQL to ClickHouse for execution. Any JOINs to `$ADOM_ENDPOINT` etc. go through the PostgreSQL proxy tables transparently.
7. ClickHouse returns results. Django formats and returns them to the GUI.

The key implication: **write queries using FAZ variables and macros, never hardcode table names or time ranges.** The engine handles device/ADOM scoping, time filtering, and database routing automatically.

### Data Storage: ClickHouse vs PostgreSQL

FAZ uses two databases internally. Understanding which data lives where explains why certain joins work and why the FAZ variables exist.

**ClickHouse** — log storage (fast columnar analytics):
- All raw log data — the rows behind `$log-traffic`, `$log-event`, `$log-webfilter`, etc.
  Stored as MergeTree tables: `tlog_sp1`, `elog_sp1`, `ulog_sp1`, `Xlog_sp1`
- Log views — `sp1_FGT_tlog`, `adom3_FGT_tlog`, etc. (scoped views over raw tables)
- Materialized views — `fv_*` (pre-aggregated metrics, used by performance dashboards)

**PostgreSQL** — identity, SIEM, and metadata (relational, lower volume):
- Endpoint/asset identity: `endpoints`, `endpoints_attr`, `endpoints_history`, `endpoints_software`, `endpoints_vuln_map`, `endpoints_iot_info`
- User identity: `endusers`, `endusers_attr`, `endusers_history`
- Mapping: `epeudevmap` (endpoint↔user↔device), `epmacip` (MAC↔IP)
- Device registry: `devtable`, `adomdevtable`, `devgrptable`
- SIEM alerts & incidents: per-ADOM `{DEV}-alerts`, `{DEV}-incidents`, `{DEV}-indicators`, etc.
- Risk scores: `risk_score_evts`, `risk_score_hist`
- UEBA events: `ueba_epeu_events`
- Policy info: `fgt_policy`, `fgt_policy_conf`, `fgt_policy_stats`
- Query cache (hcache): `{DEV}-hcache_query/ref/res`
- Fabric aggregated views: `faz_fabric_endpoints`, `faz_fabric_endusers`, etc.
- Log metadata/stats: `log_tablst`, `logstat-*`

**The bridge — PostgreSQL proxy tables in ClickHouse:**
The `siem` ClickHouse database contains table definitions that transparently proxy to PostgreSQL using the ClickHouse `PostgreSQL()` engine. This is how a single dataset query can JOIN raw log rows (ClickHouse) with endpoint or alert data (PostgreSQL) without leaving the ClickHouse query engine.

From a query-writing perspective, **you never deal with this directly.** The FAZ variables abstract it completely:

| FAZ variable | Resolves to | Backed by |
|---|---|---|
| `$log-traffic`, `$log-event`, etc. | ClickHouse log views | ClickHouse |
| `$ADOM_ENDPOINT` | `faz_fabric_endpoints` | PostgreSQL (via CH proxy) |
| `$ADOM_ENDUSER` | `faz_fabric_endusers` | PostgreSQL (via CH proxy) |
| `$ADOM_EPEU_DEVMAP` | `faz_fabric_epeudevmap` | PostgreSQL (via CH proxy) |
| `$event` | per-ADOM `{DEV}-alerts` | PostgreSQL (via CH proxy) |
| `$incident` | per-ADOM `{DEV}-incidents` | PostgreSQL (via CH proxy) |
| `$event_history` | per-ADOM `{DEV}-event_history` | PostgreSQL (via CH proxy) |
| `$incident_history` | per-ADOM `{DEV}-incident_history` | PostgreSQL (via CH proxy) |
| `fv_fgt_t_*`, `fv_ffw_e_*`, etc. | Materialized views | ClickHouse |

## 2. Dataset Metadata and `log_category`

Every FAZ dataset is more than just a SQL query — it is a named object with metadata that the query engine uses to resolve `$log` and scope the query correctly.

### Key dataset properties

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | Dataset identifier, referenced by chart/table widgets in reports |
| `description` | Human-readable description |
| `log_category` | Determines what `$log` resolves to (see table below) |
| `query` | The SQL body — the content this guide focuses on |

### `log_category` values

This is the most important metadata field. It tells the engine which log type `$log` should resolve to when no explicit `$log-*` variable is used. It also controls which device types are included in `$filter`.

| `log_category` value | `$log` resolves to | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `"traffic"` | `$log-traffic` | Firewall/session queries |
| `"webfilter"` | `$log-webfilter` | Web filter queries |
| `"app-ctrl"` | `$log-app-ctrl` | Application control |
| `"attack"` | `$log-attack` | IPS/intrusion queries |
| `"virus"` | `$log-virus` | Antivirus queries |
| `"event"` | `$log-event` | System/device event queries |
| `"dns"` | `$log-dns` | DNS filter queries |
| `"dlp"` | `$log-dlp` | Data loss prevention |
| `"emailfilter"` | `$log-emailfilter` | Email filter queries |
| `"content"` | `$log-content` | VoIP/IM content queries |
| `"file-filter"` | `$log-file-filter` | File filter queries |
| `"fct-traffic"` | `$log-fct-traffic` | FortiClient traffic |
| `"fct-event"` | `$log-fct-event` | FortiClient events |
| `""` (empty) | N/A — no log source | SOC/SIEM queries (`$event`, `$incident`) |

**Rules:**
- Always set `log_category` to match the primary log source your query reads from.
- If you use explicit `$log-traffic` (instead of `$log`), the `log_category` still matters — it controls device scoping in `$filter`.
- Queries with `log_category: ""` are for SOC tables only and should use `/*fabricStart*/`/`/*fabricEnd*/` if they need to aggregate across ADOMs.
- You can use `$log-traffic` in a dataset with `log_category: "webfilter"` but it is not recommended — the device scoping in `$filter` will be based on webfilter-capable devices, not all traffic devices.

### Using `$log` vs `$log-{category}`

Both work. The difference:
- `$log` — resolves to whatever `log_category` is set to. More portable if you want to reuse the query with different categories, but makes the query's intent less obvious.
- `$log-traffic` — explicit. Always resolves to traffic regardless of `log_category`. Preferred for clarity.

In practice, all built-in datasets use the explicit `$log-{category}` form.

---

## 3. Log Source Variables (`$log-*`)

Use `$log` or `$log-{category}` as the FROM table. The engine resolves these to the correct scoped view.

| Variable | Log Category |
|---|---|
| `$log` | Same as dataset's `log_category` |
| `$log-traffic` | Traffic/firewall sessions |
| `$log-webfilter` | Web filter events |
| `$log-app-ctrl` | Application control |
| `$log-attack` | IPS/attack events |
| `$log-virus` | Antivirus events |
| `$log-event` | System/device events |
| `$log-dlp` | Data loss prevention |
| `$log-dns` | DNS filter events |
| `$log-emailfilter` | Email filter |
| `$log-content` | Content events (VoIP, etc.) |
| `$log-fct-traffic` | FortiClient traffic |
| `$log-fct-event` | FortiClient events |
| `$log-file-filter` | File filter events |

**Rules:**
- For a dataset with `log_category: "traffic"`, use `$log` or `$log-traffic` — both resolve to the same thing.
- Cross-category queries require separate log sources joined via subqueries or temp tables.
- Never hardcode `sp1_FGT_tlog` or similar view names — these are internal and not ADOM-scoped.

**Log types in ClickHouse but NOT exposed as `$log-` variables:**
`waf`, `voip`, `ssh`, `ssl`, `netscan`, `gtp`, `protocol`, `security` — these exist in the raw ClickHouse schema but the FAZ query engine does not provide `$log-waf` etc. To query them you must hardcode the internal view name (not recommended in GUI datasets). For full column details for each log source, see §16.

> For the full column schema of each log source, see §16 (Column Reference by Log Source).

## 4. Filter Variables

These are injected by the GUI based on user selections (time range, device, ADOM).

### `$filter`
The primary filter. Always include it in every raw log query. It enforces the report time window and device scope.

```sql
SELECT hostname, count(*) as hits
FROM $log
WHERE $filter
  AND hostname IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY hostname
ORDER BY hits DESC
```

### `$filter-drilldown`
> **Dashboard feature** — only relevant when reading existing built-in drilldown datasets. Users cannot create new drilldown datasets. See [Appendix A](#appendix-a-drilldown-queries) for full details.

Used in drilldown queries applied to the **outer** query of an hcache pattern. The cached inner result already applied `$filter`; the outer query narrows further based on a drilldown selection (e.g. a specific user or application clicked in the GUI).

```sql
SELECT app, sum(sessions) as sessions
FROM ###(SELECT app, count(*) as sessions
         FROM $log
         WHERE $filter
         GROUP BY app
         ORDER BY sessions DESC)### t
WHERE $filter-drilldown   -- narrows outer result to selected drilldown value
GROUP BY app
ORDER BY sessions DESC
```

Note: Some older queries write `$filter - drilldown` (with spaces) — both work.

### `$dev_filter`
Device-only filter (no time range). Used when joining against non-log tables that already have correct scope.

### `$last3day_period`
Expands to the last 3 days time range. Used in queries that need a rolling lookback for baseline comparison, independent of the report's main period. Must be combined with `$filter` (not a replacement).

```sql
WHERE $last3day_period $filter AND ...
```

### `$pre_period`
The period immediately before the current report window. Used for before/after comparison queries — e.g. "this week vs last week". Must appear before `$filter` (same syntax as `$last3day_period`).

```sql
-- Compare current period vs previous period session counts
SELECT
    sum(CASE WHEN $pre_period THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS sessions_prev,
    sum(CASE WHEN $filter    THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS sessions_curr
FROM $log-traffic
WHERE ($pre_period OR $filter) AND (bitAnd(logflag,1)>0)
```

### `$adom_oid`
Integer ADOM OID for the current context. Rarely needed directly; `$filter` handles scoping automatically.

---

## 5. Time Variables and Functions

### `$flex_timestamp`
Groups log rows into time buckets appropriate for the report period (5 min, hour, or day). Use this in the innermost GROUP BY when building time-series data.

```sql
SELECT $flex_timestamp AS timestamp, srcip, sum(sentbyte) as traffic_out
FROM $log
WHERE $filter
GROUP BY timestamp, srcip
```

`$flex_timestamp` is a column expression — it does not take arguments. It returns an integer epoch representing the bucket start.

### `$flex_timescale(col)`
Formats a bucketed timestamp column for display. Use in the outermost SELECT when presenting time-series to the GUI.

```sql
SELECT $flex_timescale(timestamp) AS hodex, sum(traffic_out) as traffic_out
FROM (...)
GROUP BY hodex
ORDER BY hodex
```

### `$fv_line_timescale(col)`
Like `$flex_timescale` but for queries reading from `fv_*` materialized views (which store pre-aggregated `timescale` column values).

```sql
SELECT $fv_line_timescale(timescale) AS time, sum(sessions) as sessions
FROM fv_fgt_t_src_dst_5min_sp1
WHERE $filter
GROUP BY time
ORDER BY time
```

### `$flex_datetime(col)` / `from_itime(col)` / `from_dtime(col)`
Convert integer epoch timestamps to human-readable datetime strings.

- `from_itime(itime)` — for `itime`-style Unix timestamps (Int32 seconds)
- `from_dtime(dtime)` — for `dtime`-style timestamps (used in event logs)
- `$flex_datetime(timestamp)` — adapts to report period format

```sql
SELECT from_itime($flex_timestamp) AS timestamp, user, msg
FROM $log
WHERE $filter
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
```

### `$hour_of_day` / `$hour_of_day(col)`
Groups by hour 0–23. Use for "by hour of day" distribution queries.

```sql
SELECT $hour_of_day AS hourstamp, count(*) AS requests
FROM $log-traffic
WHERE $filter
GROUP BY hourstamp
ORDER BY hourstamp
```

Or with an explicit column (e.g. when reading from a cached subquery result):
```sql
SELECT $hour_of_day(timestamp) AS hourstamp, sum(totalnum) AS totalnum
FROM ###(...)### t
GROUP BY hourstamp
ORDER BY hourstamp
```

### `$DAY_OF_MONTH` / `$day_of_week`
Similar to `$hour_of_day` but for day-of-month (1–31) and day-of-week (0=Sunday) distributions.

### `$cust_time_filter(col)` / `$cust_time_filter(col, PRESET)`
For filtering non-log tables (like incident or alert tables) by the report time window.

```sql
SELECT alertid, alerttime, severity
FROM $ADOM_ENDPOINT_alerts
WHERE $cust_time_filter(alerttime)
```

Presets: `TODAY`, `YESTERDAY`, `LAST_N_PERIOD,1`

### `$start_time` / `$end_time`
The raw start/end Unix timestamps of the report period. Available for use in expressions.

### `$timespan`
The report period duration in seconds. Useful for rate calculations.

### `$days_num`
The number of days in the report period. Use for computing daily averages:

```sql
SELECT cast(sum(sessions)/$days_num AS decimal(18,0)) AS avg_sessions_per_day
FROM ###(...)### t
```

### `$flex_timestamp(col)` (with explicit column argument)
`$flex_timestamp` normally reads `itime` implicitly. When you need to bucket by a different timestamp column, call it with an argument:

```sql
$flex_timestamp(dtime) AS timestamp   -- bucket by device time instead of ingestion time
```

### `$calendar_time`
Similar to `$flex_timestamp` but aligned to calendar boundaries (midnight, hour start). Used in config-change timeline queries where you want whole-hour or whole-day buckets rather than report-period-relative buckets.

```sql
SELECT $calendar_time AS timestamp, user, msg
FROM $log-event
WHERE $filter AND cfgtid > 0
GROUP BY timestamp, user, msg
ORDER BY timestamp
```

## 6. The HCache Mechanism (`###...###`)

The most important performance pattern in FAZ queries. HCache executes the inner subquery separately, caches the result by a hash of the query text, then the outer query reads from the cached result.

### How it works under the hood

When the FAZ query engine encounters `###(subquery)###`, it:

1. Extracts the inner subquery text and computes a SHA hash of it (after template expansion, so `$filter` is already resolved to the actual time range).
2. Looks up that hash in the PostgreSQL hcache tables (`{DEV}-hcache_query` and `{DEV}-hcache_res`).
3. **Cache hit:** reads the previously stored result set directly from PostgreSQL — the expensive ClickHouse log scan is skipped entirely.
4. **Cache miss:** executes the inner subquery against ClickHouse, stores the result rows in `{DEV}-hcache_res` in PostgreSQL, records the hash in `{DEV}-hcache_query`.
5. Either way, the outer query runs against the (now-cached) result as if it were an inline subquery.

**Cache lifetime:** the cache is scoped to a report run session. Multiple datasets within the same report that share the same inner query text (same hash) all benefit from the single cached result. The cache does not persist across separate report runs.

**What this means in practice:** the first dataset in a report that triggers a given inner query pays the full ClickHouse scan cost. Every subsequent dataset referencing the same inner query (or named base tag) gets the result from PostgreSQL for near-zero cost.

### When to use hcache

Use hcache when **any** of the following apply:

**1. You need to filter on a computed or aliased column**

The most common reason. ClickHouse cannot reference a SELECT alias in the same query's WHERE clause. Hcache makes the computed column available for filtering in the outer query.

```sql
-- Need to filter on coalesce result? Must use hcache.
SELECT user_src, count(*) AS sessions
FROM ###(
    SELECT coalesce(nullifna(`user`), nullifna(`unauthuser`), ipstr(`srcip`)) AS user_src,
           count(*) AS sessions
    FROM $log-traffic
    WHERE $filter AND (bitAnd(logflag,1)>0)
    GROUP BY user_src
)### t
WHERE user_src IS NOT NULL   -- filtering on computed alias — only possible via hcache
GROUP BY user_src
ORDER BY sessions DESC
```

**2. You need two levels of aggregation**

When you aggregate at fine granularity in the inner query (e.g. per-user-per-app-per-timestamp) and then re-aggregate at a coarser level in the outer query (e.g. per-user totals). Without hcache this requires either a subquery or duplicating the GROUP BY.

```sql
-- Inner: fine-grained (user + app + time bucket)
-- Outer: coarser (user totals only)
SELECT user_src, sum(bandwidth) AS bandwidth
FROM ###(
    SELECT user_src, app, $flex_timestamp AS ts,
           sum(coalesce(sentdelta,sentbyte,0)+coalesce(rcvddelta,rcvdbyte,0)) AS bandwidth
    FROM $log-traffic
    WHERE $filter AND (bitAnd(logflag,bitOr(1,32))>0)
    GROUP BY user_src, app, ts
    /*SkipSTART*/ORDER BY bandwidth DESC/*SkipEND*/
)### t
GROUP BY user_src
ORDER BY bandwidth DESC
```

**3. Multiple datasets in the same report share the same base scan**

Any report that shows multiple charts from the same log source (e.g. "top users", "top apps", "traffic over time" — all from traffic logs) should use a named base cache so the ClickHouse scan happens once. See the named base cache section below.

**4. Time series queries**

Always use hcache for time-series. The `$flex_timestamp` bucketing goes in the inner GROUP BY, `$flex_timescale()` wrapping goes in the outer SELECT. This is the standard two-level aggregation pattern.

**5. You want sorted cache population for top-N**

Adding `/*SkipSTART*/ORDER BY col DESC/*SkipEND*/` inside the hcache tells the engine to store the cache in sorted order, so the outer query can efficiently take the top-N without a full sort.

### When NOT to use hcache

Skip hcache when:
- The query is a simple single-pass aggregation with no computed column filtering — the overhead of writing and reading the cache outweighs any benefit.
- You are querying a reference table (`$ADOM_ENDPOINT`, `$event`, etc.) rather than raw logs — these are already small and fast.
- The query is a detail/list query (no aggregation at all, just `SELECT ... ORDER BY itime DESC LIMIT 100`) — hcache is designed for aggregations, not row fetches.

```sql
-- Simple enough — no hcache needed
SELECT catdesc, count(*) AS hits
FROM $log-webfilter
WHERE $filter AND utmaction = 'block' AND catdesc IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY catdesc
ORDER BY hits DESC
```

### Basic syntax

```sql
SELECT col_a, sum(col_b) AS total
FROM ###(
    SELECT col_a, col_b, col_c
    FROM $log
    WHERE $filter
    GROUP BY col_a, col_b, col_c
    /*SkipSTART*/ORDER BY col_b DESC/*SkipEND*/
)### t
WHERE col_c = 'some_value'      -- filter on inner columns
GROUP BY col_a
ORDER BY total DESC
```

The alias `t` after `###` is required.

### Named base cache (`###base(...)base###`)

When multiple datasets in a report share the same expensive base query, wrap it in `###base(/*tag:label*/...)base###`. All datasets in the same report run that reference the same tag share one cached result — the ClickHouse scan runs exactly once regardless of how many datasets reference it.

The `/*tag:label*/` string is the cache key. It must be unique across your report. The convention from the built-in datasets is `rpt_base_{logtype}_{description}`.

**The most important predefined base cache — traffic bandwidth and sessions:**

This is the base query used by the built-in bandwidth, top-users, top-apps, and sessions reports. If you are writing any traffic-based dataset that belongs in a report alongside those, reuse this exact tag and query structure so your dataset shares the cache.

```sql
###base(/*tag:rpt_base_t_bndwdth_sess*/
    SELECT $flex_timestamp AS timestamp,
           dvid, srcip, dstip,
           epid, euid, appcat, apprisk,
           coalesce(nullifna(`user`), nullifna(`unauthuser`), ipstr(`srcip`)) AS user_src,
           service,
           sum(CASE WHEN (bitAnd(logflag,1)>0) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS sessions,
           sum(coalesce(sentdelta,sentbyte,0)+coalesce(rcvddelta,rcvdbyte,0)) AS bandwidth,
           sum(coalesce(sentdelta,sentbyte,0)) AS traffic_out,
           sum(coalesce(rcvddelta,rcvdbyte,0)) AS traffic_in
    FROM $log-traffic
    WHERE $filter AND (bitAnd(logflag,bitOr(1,32))>0)
    GROUP BY timestamp, dvid, srcip, dstip, epid, euid, appcat, apprisk, user_src, service
    /*SkipSTART*/ORDER BY bandwidth DESC, sessions DESC/*SkipEND*/
)base###
```

This base query intentionally carries many dimensions (`dvid`, `srcip`, `dstip`, `epid`, `euid`, `appcat`, `apprisk`, `user_src`, `service`, `timestamp`) so that any dataset reading from it can group or filter by any subset. The outer query then re-aggregates to the specific dimensions it needs.

**Example: two datasets sharing the base**

```sql
-- Dataset 1: bandwidth timeline
SELECT $flex_timescale(timestamp) AS hodex,
       sum(traffic_out) AS traffic_out,
       sum(traffic_in) AS traffic_in
FROM ###(
    SELECT timestamp,
           sum(traffic_out) AS traffic_out,
           sum(traffic_in) AS traffic_in
    FROM ###base(/*tag:rpt_base_t_bndwdth_sess*/
        -- ... same base query as above ...
    )base### base_query
    GROUP BY timestamp
)### t
GROUP BY hodex
HAVING sum(traffic_out+traffic_in) > 0
ORDER BY hodex

-- Dataset 2: top users by bandwidth (same report, same base — no second ClickHouse scan)
SELECT user_src, sum(bandwidth) AS bandwidth
FROM ###(
    SELECT user_src, sum(bandwidth) AS bandwidth
    FROM ###base(/*tag:rpt_base_t_bndwdth_sess*/
        -- ... same base query ...
    )base### base_query
    GROUP BY user_src
    /*SkipSTART*/ORDER BY bandwidth DESC/*SkipEND*/
)### t
GROUP BY user_src
ORDER BY bandwidth DESC
```

### What to put inside vs outside hcache

**Inside the `###(...)###`:**
- `FROM $log-*` with `WHERE $filter` — the raw log scan must be here
- All columns you might ever need to filter or group by in the outer query — you cannot reference a column in the outer WHERE if it was not selected in the inner query
- Aggregations at the finest granularity needed (user + app + timestamp, not just user)
- `/*SkipSTART*/ORDER BY col DESC/*SkipEND*/` when you want the cache sorted for top-N (see §13)

**Outside the `###(...)###`:**
- Final re-aggregation (SUM, COUNT over the cached rows)
- Filter conditions on computed columns (`WHERE user_src IS NOT NULL`, `WHERE app = 'HTTP'`)
- `HAVING` to filter on aggregated values (`HAVING sum(bytes) > 0`)
- Final `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`
- `$flex_timescale(timestamp)` wrapping for time-series display

## 7. ADOM Reference Tables

These are FAZ-managed lookup tables scoped to the current ADOM. They are **not** ClickHouse tables — the FAZ engine resolves them before hitting ClickHouse.

| Variable | Contains |
|---|---|
| `$ADOM_ENDPOINT` | Endpoint devices (name, IP, MAC, etc.) |
| `$ADOM_ENDUSER` | End users (username, display name) |
| `$ADOM_EPEU_DEVMAP` | Endpoint-to-enduser device mapping |
| `$ADOM_INTF_INFO` | Interface information |
| `$ADOM_INTF_STATS` | Interface statistics |
| `$ADOM_SDWAN_INTF_INFO` | SD-WAN interface info |
| `$ADOMTBL_PLHD_POLINFO` | Policy information |
| `$ADOMTBL_PLHD_AUDIT_HST` | Audit history |
| `$ADOMTBL_PLHD_IOC_VERDICT` | IoC verdict data |

### Joining endpoint data to log data

The typical pattern for enriching log rows with endpoint/user information:

```sql
SELECT
    coalesce(f_user, euname, ipstr(`srcip`)) AS user_src,
    coalesce(epname, ipstr(`srcip`)) AS ep_src,
    sum(bandwidth) AS bandwidth
FROM (
    -- Step 1: aggregate from logs, carry epid/euid for joining
    SELECT dvid, f_user, srcip, ep_id, eu_id, sum(bandwidth) AS bandwidth
    FROM ###(
        SELECT dvid,
               coalesce(nullifna(`user`), nullifna(`unauthuser`)) AS f_user,
               srcip,
               (CASE WHEN epid < 1024 THEN NULL ELSE epid END) AS ep_id,
               (CASE WHEN euid < 1024 THEN NULL ELSE euid END) AS eu_id,
               sum(coalesce(sentbyte,0)+coalesce(rcvdbyte,0)) AS bandwidth
        FROM $log-traffic
        WHERE $filter AND (bitAnd(logflag,1)>0)
        GROUP BY dvid, f_user, srcip, ep_id, eu_id
        /*SkipSTART*/ORDER BY bandwidth DESC/*SkipEND*/
    )### t
    GROUP BY dvid, f_user, srcip, ep_id, eu_id
) log_data
-- Step 2: left join to resolve names
LEFT JOIN $ADOM_ENDPOINT ep ON log_data.ep_id = ep.epid
LEFT JOIN $ADOM_ENDUSER eu  ON log_data.eu_id  = eu.euid
GROUP BY user_src, ep_src
ORDER BY bandwidth DESC
```

**Note:** `epid < 1024` and `euid < 1024` are system/unassigned IDs — always null them out before joining.

### `devtable_ext` — Extended Device Table

A special reference table available in SOC/event queries that provides device name and type information by `dvid`. It is the standard way to resolve a numeric `dvid` to a human-readable device name.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `dvid` | Device ID (join key — matches `dvid` on log rows and `$event`) |
| `devname` | Device display name |
| `devtype` | Device type string |
| `devid` | Device serial/identifier string |

```sql
-- Resolve device name in an alert query
SELECT e.triggername, d.devname, e.severity, count(*) AS cnt
FROM $event e
LEFT JOIN devtable_ext d ON e.dvid = d.dvid
WHERE $cust_time_filter(e.alerttime)
GROUP BY e.triggername, d.devname, e.severity
ORDER BY cnt DESC
```

**`$incident` columns:**

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `incid` | Int64 | Incident ID — use `incid_to_str(incid)` for display |

**Key patterns:**

```sql
-- Top alert trigger names today
SELECT triggername,
       CASE severity WHEN 0 THEN 'Critical' WHEN 1 THEN 'High'
                     WHEN 2 THEN 'Medium'   WHEN 3 THEN 'Low' END AS sev,
       count(*) AS cnt
FROM $event
WHERE $cust_time_filter(alerttime, TODAY)
GROUP BY triggername, severity
ORDER BY severity, cnt DESC

-- Open incidents
SELECT incid_to_str(incid) AS incnum,
       from_itime(createtime) AS ts,
       severity, status, endpoint, description
FROM $incident
WHERE $cust_time_filter(createtime)
  AND status NOT IN ('closed','cancelled')
ORDER BY severity DESC

-- Incident count trend (using pre-aggregated history)
SELECT $flex_timescale(agg_time) AS hodex,
       max(num_sta_draft) + max(num_sta_analysis) + max(num_sta_response) AS open
FROM $incident_history
WHERE $cust_time_filter(agg_time)
GROUP BY hodex
ORDER BY hodex
```

> **`incid_to_str(incid)`:** Built-in function to convert numeric incid to a human-readable incident number string (e.g. `"INC-00123"`).

## 9. Essential Helper Functions

### `ipstr(col)`
Converts a Nullable(IPv6) column to a clean IPv4/IPv6 string. Always use this when displaying or comparing IP addresses — raw IPv6-mapped IPv4 addresses (e.g. `::ffff:192.168.1.1`) are not readable.

```sql
ipstr(`srcip`)   -- → "192.168.1.1"
ipstr(`dstip`)   -- → "10.0.0.1"
```

### `nullifna(col)`
Returns NULL if the column value is `"N/A"`, `"n/a"`, or the literal string `"null"`. Essential for string columns that use these sentinel values instead of SQL NULL.

```sql
nullifna(`user`)         -- NULL if user is "N/A", otherwise the value
nullifna(`unauthuser`)   -- same
```

### `coalesce(nullifna(`user`), nullifna(`unauthuser`), ipstr(`srcip`))`
The canonical user identity expression for traffic logs. Returns the first non-null of: authenticated username → unauthenticated username → source IP string.

```sql
coalesce(nullifna(`user`), nullifna(`unauthuser`), ipstr(`srcip`)) AS user_src
```

### `app_group_name(app)`
Maps application names to their application group. Use when grouping by application category at a higher level.

```sql
app_group_name(app) AS app_group
```

### `root_domain(hostname)`
Extracts the root domain from a full hostname (e.g. `mail.google.com` → `google.com`). Use for domain-level aggregation in webfilter queries.

```sql
coalesce(root_domain(hostname), ipstr(dstip)) AS domain
```

### `get_devtype(devtype_int)`
Converts a numeric device type code to its string name.

### `virusid_to_str(virusid)`
Converts a numeric virus ID to its string name.

### `logid_to_int(logid)`
Converts a logid string to integer for numeric comparison.

```sql
WHERE logid_to_int(logid) = 26001   -- specific log ID filter
```

### `from_itime(col)` / `from_dtime(col)`
Converts Unix epoch integer to a readable datetime string.

```sql
from_itime(itime) AS event_time
from_dtime(dtime) AS config_time
```

### `bandwidth_unit(bytes)` / `format_numeric_no_decimal(n)`
Display formatting helpers. Use at the outermost SELECT level only.

### `regexp_replace(col, pattern, replacement)`
Standard regex replacement. FAZ uses PostgreSQL regex syntax in some contexts.

```sql
regexp_replace(msg, '[^ ]*$', '') AS msg_trim
```

### `bitAnd(a, b)` / `bitOr(a, b)`
Bitwise operations, required for `logflag` checks. See §10.

### `JSONExtractString(col, key)` / `JSONExtractInt(col, key)`
For extracting fields from JSON-formatted string columns.

### `incid_to_str(incid)`
Converts a numeric incident ID to a display string (e.g. `"INC-00042"`). Use in the outermost SELECT when presenting incident IDs.

### `string_agg(col, delimiter)`
Aggregate function that concatenates distinct string values. Useful for building comma-separated lists.

```sql
string_agg(distinct virus, ',') AS virus_list
```

### `array_join(array_col)` / `arrayJoin(array_col)`
Unnests an array column into individual rows. Used with `threats`, `ipaddr`, `apps`, etc.

```sql
SELECT qname, ipstr(arrayJoin(ipaddr)) AS resolved_ip
FROM $log-dns WHERE $filter AND length(ipaddr) > 0
```

### `split_part(col, delimiter, n)`
Splits a string by delimiter and returns the nth part (1-indexed). Useful for FCT `os` column.

```sql
split_part(os, ',', 1) AS os_family   -- "Windows 10" from "Windows 10,x64,10.0.19041"
```

### `left(col, n)`
Truncates a string to n characters. Use for long aggregated strings in display.

```sql
left(string_agg(distinct url, ','), 1000) AS url_list
```

### `lower(col)`
Lowercase a string. Use for case-insensitive comparison on `utmevent`, `threat`, `subtype` etc.

```sql
WHERE lower(utmevent) = 'webfilter'
WHERE lower(utmevent) IN ('antivirus', 'antimalware')
WHERE lower(threat) LIKE '%botnet%'
```

### `timestampDiff('unit', col1, col2)`
Difference between two timestamps. Units: `'second'`, `'millisecond'`, `'nanosecond'`.

```sql
timestampDiff('nanosecond', reqtime, respfinishtime) AS latency_ns
```

### `severity_s2i(col)`
Converts a severity string to a sortable integer (FortiClient vulnerability severity). Use for `ORDER BY severity_level DESC`.

```sql
severity_s2i(vulnseverity) AS severity_level
```

### `fct_webcat(threat)`
Returns the web category name from a FortiClient threat field.

```sql
fct_webcat(threat) AS category
```

### `lagInFrame(col) OVER (...)`
Window function — returns the previous row's value. Use for detecting state changes (e.g. link up/down transitions).

```sql
link_status - lagInFrame(link_status) OVER (
    PARTITION BY devid ORDER BY timestamp
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
) AS status_switch
```

## 10. The `logflag` Bitmask

The `logflag` column exists on traffic log rows and controls which rows count as "real" sessions for reporting. Always apply the correct logflag filter in traffic queries.

| Bit | Value | Meaning | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | `REPORT_SESSION` | Session counted in reports | Almost always |
| 1 | 2 | `BLOCKED_ACTION` | Action was blocked | Blocked-only queries |
| 2 | 4 | `CLOUD_APP` | Cloud app session | Cloud app queries |
| 3 | 8 | `FCT_SYSUSR` | FortiClient system user | Exclude for end-user only |
| 4 | 16 | `BOTNET` | Botnet session | Botnet queries |
| 5 | 32 | `LONGLIVE_SESSION` | Long-lived session | Include with report sessions |

### Standard filters

```sql
-- Normal session reporting (most common)
WHERE $filter AND (bitAnd(logflag, 1) > 0)

-- Include long-lived sessions (e.g. bandwidth queries — sessions that span report boundaries)
WHERE $filter AND (bitAnd(logflag, bitOr(1,32)) > 0)

-- Blocked sessions only
WHERE $filter AND (bitAnd(logflag, 2) > 0)

-- Botnet sessions
WHERE $filter AND (bitAnd(logflag, 16) > 0)

-- Exclude FortiClient system user (report on end users only)
WHERE $filter AND (bitAnd(logflag, 1) > 0) AND (bitAnd(logflag, 8) = 0)
```

**Use `bitOr(1,32)` for bandwidth/bytes queries** — long-lived sessions (e.g. file downloads spanning hours) contribute bytes but logflag=32 instead of 1.

---

## 11. Query Patterns by Use Case

### Pattern A: Simple Top-N (no hcache)

Best for: simple counts or sums with no need for intermediate filtering.

```sql
SELECT
    coalesce(nullifna(`user`), ipstr(`srcip`)) AS user_src,
    count(*) AS requests
FROM $log-webfilter
WHERE $filter
  AND utmevent IN ('webfilter','banned-word','web-content','command-block','script-filter')
  AND hostname IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY user_src
ORDER BY requests DESC
```

Use when:
- Single aggregation pass is sufficient
- No computed columns need filtering after aggregation
- Query is simple enough that hcache overhead isn't worth it

### Pattern B: Top-N with HCache (most common)

Best for: top-N lists where you need to filter by computed columns or share the base result.

```sql
SELECT user_src, sum(sessions) AS sessions
FROM ###(
    SELECT
        coalesce(nullifna(`user`), nullifna(`unauthuser`), ipstr(`srcip`)) AS user_src,
        count(*) AS sessions
    FROM $log-traffic
    WHERE $filter AND (bitAnd(logflag,1) > 0)
    GROUP BY user_src
    /*SkipSTART*/ORDER BY sessions DESC/*SkipEND*/
)### t
GROUP BY user_src
ORDER BY sessions DESC
```

### Pattern C: Time Series

```sql
SELECT $flex_timescale(timestamp) AS hodex,
       sum(traffic_out) AS traffic_out,
       sum(traffic_in) AS traffic_in
FROM ###(
    SELECT $flex_timestamp AS timestamp,
           sum(coalesce(sentbyte,0)) AS traffic_out,
           sum(coalesce(rcvdbyte,0)) AS traffic_in
    FROM $log-traffic
    WHERE $filter AND (bitAnd(logflag,bitOr(1,32)) > 0)
    GROUP BY timestamp
)### t
GROUP BY hodex
HAVING sum(traffic_out + traffic_in) > 0
ORDER BY hodex
```

> See §6 for when to use hcache for time series and §13 for the SkipSTART hint.

### Pattern D: Hour-of-Day / Day-of-Week Distribution

```sql
SELECT $hour_of_day AS hourstamp, sum(totalnum) AS totalnum
FROM ###(
    SELECT $hour_of_day AS hourstamp,
           action, count(*) AS totalnum
    FROM $log-webfilter
    WHERE $filter
    GROUP BY hourstamp, action
    /*SkipSTART*/ORDER BY totalnum DESC/*SkipEND*/
)### t
WHERE action = 'block'
GROUP BY hourstamp
ORDER BY hourstamp
```

### Pattern E: Condition-based session counting

```sql
sum(CASE WHEN (bitAnd(logflag,2)>0) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS blocked_sessions,
sum(CASE WHEN (bitAnd(logflag,1)>0) AND (bitAnd(logflag,2)=0) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS allowed_sessions
```

### Pattern F: Direction-based source/victim

For IPS/attack queries where attacker/victim depends on traffic direction:

```sql
SELECT
    CASE WHEN direction = 'incoming' THEN ipstr(srcip) ELSE ipstr(dstip) END AS victim,
    CASE WHEN direction = 'incoming' THEN ipstr(dstip) ELSE ipstr(srcip) END AS attacker,
    count(*) AS totalnum
FROM $log-attack
WHERE $filter
GROUP BY victim, attacker
ORDER BY totalnum DESC
```

---

## 10. Multi-Statement Queries with Temp Tables

For complex queries requiring multiple passes, FAZ supports multi-statement queries using `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE`.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS rpt_tmptbl_1;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS rpt_tmptbl_2;

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE rpt_tmptbl_1 AS
SELECT devintf, mac
FROM ###(
    SELECT concat(interface, '.', devid) AS devintf, mac, count(*) AS total_num
    FROM $log-event
    WHERE $last3day_period $filter AND logid_to_int(logid) = 26001
    GROUP BY devintf, mac
    /*SkipSTART*/ORDER BY total_num DESC/*SkipEND*/
)### t
GROUP BY devintf, mac;

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE rpt_tmptbl_2 AS
SELECT devintf, mac
FROM ###(
    SELECT concat(interface, '.', devid) AS devintf, mac, count(*) AS total_num
    FROM $log-event
    WHERE $filter AND logid_to_int(logid) = 26001
    GROUP BY devintf, mac
    /*SkipSTART*/ORDER BY total_num DESC/*SkipEND*/
)### t
GROUP BY devintf, mac;

-- Final query joining temp tables
SELECT t1.devintf, t1.mac,
       CASE WHEN t2.mac IS NULL THEN 'New' ELSE 'Existing' END AS status
FROM rpt_tmptbl_1 t1
LEFT JOIN rpt_tmptbl_2 t2 ON t1.devintf=t2.devintf AND t1.mac=t2.mac;
```

**Rules:**
- Always `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` each temp table before creating it
- Name temp tables `rpt_tmptbl_1`, `rpt_tmptbl_2`, etc.
- Each statement is separated by `;`
- The final SELECT (no trailing `;`) is the dataset output
- Temp tables only exist for the duration of the report execution session

---

## 11. The `SkipSTART`/`SkipEND` Hint

```sql
/*SkipSTART*/ORDER BY col DESC/*SkipEND*/
```

This hint tells the query engine to **include** the ORDER BY when executing the hcache subquery (so the cache is ordered for top-N retrieval), but **skip** it when the same query text is used in other contexts that don't need ordering.

This appears in 217 of 998 queries. Always use it inside `###(...)###` when you want the hcache to be populated in sorted order:

```sql
FROM ###(
    SELECT user_src, count(*) AS sessions
    FROM $log
    WHERE $filter
    GROUP BY user_src
    /*SkipSTART*/ORDER BY sessions DESC/*SkipEND*/
)### t
```

Without it, the ORDER BY inside hcache would conflict with outer query optimization. Without any ORDER BY in the hcache, the cache is unordered (fine for most aggregations, but wasteful for top-N).

---

## 12. Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Missing `$filter`
Every raw log query MUST have `$filter`. Without it the query scans all time and all devices.

```sql
-- WRONG
SELECT srcip FROM $log-traffic GROUP BY srcip

-- CORRECT
SELECT srcip FROM $log-traffic WHERE $filter GROUP BY srcip
```

### Mistake 2: Filtering on computed columns without hcache

```sql
-- WRONG — can't filter on coalesce result in same query
SELECT coalesce(nullifna(`user`), ipstr(srcip)) AS user_src
FROM $log-traffic
WHERE $filter AND user_src IS NOT NULL   -- user_src doesn't exist at WHERE time
GROUP BY user_src

-- CORRECT — use hcache or subquery
SELECT user_src, count(*) AS sessions
FROM ###(
    SELECT coalesce(nullifna(`user`), ipstr(`srcip`)) AS user_src
    FROM $log-traffic
    WHERE $filter AND (bitAnd(logflag,1)>0)
    GROUP BY user_src
)### t
WHERE user_src IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY user_src
ORDER BY sessions DESC
```

### Mistake 3: Using raw IP columns without `ipstr()`

```sql
-- WRONG — returns ::ffff:192.168.1.1 format
SELECT srcip, count(*) as c FROM $log WHERE $filter GROUP BY srcip

-- CORRECT
SELECT ipstr(`srcip`) AS srcip, count(*) as c FROM $log WHERE $filter GROUP BY srcip
```

### Mistake 4: Not using `nullifna()` for string columns

```sql
-- WRONG — "N/A" strings treated as valid values
SELECT `user`, count(*) AS sessions
FROM $log WHERE $filter AND `user` IS NOT NULL GROUP BY `user`

-- CORRECT
SELECT nullifna(`user`) AS user_src, count(*) AS sessions
FROM $log WHERE $filter AND nullifna(`user`) IS NOT NULL GROUP BY user_src
```

### Mistake 5: Forgetting logflag filter in traffic queries

Traffic logs include internal/system rows that inflate counts. Without logflag filtering you get wrong numbers.

```sql
-- WRONG for session counting
SELECT count(*) AS sessions FROM $log-traffic WHERE $filter

-- CORRECT
SELECT count(*) AS sessions FROM $log-traffic WHERE $filter AND (bitAnd(logflag,1)>0)
```

### Mistake 6: Using bandwidth bytes without handling long-lived sessions

```sql
-- WRONG for bandwidth — misses sessions that span time periods (logflag=32)
WHERE $filter AND (bitAnd(logflag,1)>0)

-- CORRECT for bandwidth
WHERE $filter AND (bitAnd(logflag,bitOr(1,32))>0)
```

### Mistake 7: Hardcoding table names

```sql
-- WRONG — bypasses ADOM scoping, exposes internal architecture
FROM siem.sp1_FGT_tlog

-- CORRECT
FROM $log-traffic
```

### Mistake 8: Forgetting HAVING for time series zero-filtering

```sql
-- WRONG — WHERE can't filter on aggregated sum
SELECT $flex_timescale(timestamp) AS hodex, sum(bytes) AS bytes
FROM ###(...)### t
WHERE bytes > 0   -- bytes not available at WHERE time for outer query
GROUP BY hodex

-- CORRECT
SELECT $flex_timescale(timestamp) AS hodex, sum(bytes) AS bytes
FROM ###(...)### t
GROUP BY hodex
HAVING sum(bytes) > 0
ORDER BY hodex
```

### Mistake 9: Using epid/euid values < 1024 for endpoint joins

System-assigned IDs (< 1024) are not real endpoints. Joining on them produces garbage.

```sql
-- CORRECT — null out system IDs before joining
(CASE WHEN epid < 1024 THEN NULL ELSE epid END) AS ep_id,
(CASE WHEN euid < 1024 THEN NULL ELSE euid END) AS eu_id,
```

### Mistake 10: Putting `$filter-drilldown` inside hcache

The drilldown filter must go on the **outer** query. If you put it inside, the cached result is already filtered and can't be reused for other drilldown values.

```sql
-- WRONG
FROM ###(SELECT ... FROM $log WHERE $filter AND $filter-drilldown ...)### t

-- CORRECT
FROM ###(SELECT ... FROM $log WHERE $filter ...)### t
WHERE $filter-drilldown
```

## 16. Column Gotchas and Type Notes

### IPv6 columns (`Nullable(IPv6)`)
All IP address columns (`srcip`, `dstip`, `botnetip`, etc.) are stored as `IPv6` internally. IPv4 addresses are stored in IPv4-mapped format (`::ffff:192.168.1.1`). **Always use `ipstr(col)`** to get a clean display string. Raw comparison also works: `srcip = toIPv6('192.168.1.1')`.

### LowCardinality columns
Many string columns are `LowCardinality(String)`. These have implicit dictionary encoding. You can filter them with `= 'value'` or `IN (...)` normally. They support `IS NULL` but NOT `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM`.

### `N/A` sentinel values
String columns like `user`, `unauthuser`, `app` often contain the literal string `"N/A"` or `"n/a"` instead of SQL NULL. **Always use `nullifna(col)`** before checking `IS NOT NULL` or using the value in display.

### `sentbyte` vs `sentdelta`
- `sentbyte` / `rcvdbyte` — total bytes for the session at close time
- `sentdelta` / `rcvddelta` — bytes since last update (for long-lived sessions that report periodically)
- Use: `coalesce(sentdelta, sentbyte, 0)` to get the right value in all cases

### `itime` vs `dtime` vs `eventtime`
- `itime` — when FAZ ingested the log (DateTime)
- `dtime` — when the event occurred on the device (DateTime)
- `eventtime` — UInt64 microseconds (for sub-second precision)
- `$filter` filters on `itime`. Use `from_itime(itime)` or `from_dtime(dtime)` for display.

### Array columns (traffic log)
The `threats`, `threattyps`, `apps`, `threatwgts`, `threatcnts`, `threatlvls`, `ebtime`, `saasinfo` columns are arrays. Access with:
```sql
arrayJoin(threats) AS threat        -- expand array to rows
has(threats, 'Botnets') AS is_botnet  -- test membership
length(threats) > 0 AS has_threats  -- check non-empty
```

### `logid` as string
`logid` is stored as `LowCardinality(String)`, not an integer. Use `logid_to_int(logid)` for numeric comparison:
```sql
WHERE logid_to_int(logid) BETWEEN 26000 AND 26099   -- config change events
WHERE logid_to_int(logid) = 20101                    -- specific event
```

### `dvid` vs `devid`
- `dvid` (Int32) — numeric device ID used in log tables and joins
- `devid` (String) — string device identifier (in `devtable`) like `"FGT60F1234567890"`
- Join: `log.dvid = devtable.dvid` then read `devtable.devname`

### `epid` / `euid` threshold
IDs < 1024 are system-reserved and meaningless for endpoint/user joins. Always guard:
```sql
(CASE WHEN epid < 1024 THEN NULL ELSE epid END) AS ep_id
```

## 17. `logid` Reference

Common `logid` values used to filter specific event types from `$log-event`. Always use `logid_to_int(logid)` for numeric comparison since `logid` is stored as a string.

### FortiGate Event Log IDs

| logid | Category | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `32001` | Auth | Admin login success |
| `32002` | Auth | Admin login failed |
| `32003` | Auth | Admin logout |
| `44547` | Config | FortiManager config change (FAZ-managed device) |
| `26001` | DHCP | DHCP lease assignment (includes MAC, IP, interface) |
| `26003` | DHCP | DHCP release/expiry |
| `20099` | Interface | Interface status change (up/down) |
| `22105` | Hardware | Power supply fault |
| `22107` | Hardware | Fan fault |
| `22108` | Hardware | Fan fault (alternate) |
| `22109` | Hardware | Temperature too high |
| `35011` | HA | HA failover — primary role elected |
| `35012` | HA | HA failover — device became subordinate |
| `35013` | HA | HA split-brain detected |
| `37892`–`37908` | HA | HA member join/leave and sync events |
| `22925` | SD-WAN | SD-WAN link quality/SLA measurement event |
| `22933` | SD-WAN | SD-WAN SLA fail |
| `22936` | SD-WAN | SD-WAN link degraded |
| `22938` | SD-WAN | SD-WAN link restored |
| `43521`–`43585` | WiFi | Rogue/unclassified AP detection events |
| `43522` | WiFi | Managed AP joined |
| `43551` | WiFi | Managed AP left |
| `9233` | Sandbox | FortiCloud/FortiSandbox file scan result |
| `54200` | DNS | DNS query timeout/failure |

### Config Change Pattern

```sql
-- All config changes with before/after
SELECT from_dtime(dtime) AS ts, `user`, ui,
       cfgpath, cfgobj, cfgattr, old_value, new_value, msg
FROM $log-event
WHERE $filter AND cfgtid > 0
ORDER BY dtime DESC
```

### DHCP MAC Tracking Pattern

```sql
-- New MAC addresses seen in current period vs previous 3 days
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS rpt_tmptbl_1;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS rpt_tmptbl_2;

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE rpt_tmptbl_1 AS
SELECT devintf, mac FROM ###(
    SELECT concat(interface,'.', devid) AS devintf, mac, count(*) AS n
    FROM $log-event
    WHERE $last3day_period $filter AND logid_to_int(logid) = 26001
    GROUP BY devintf, mac /*SkipSTART*/ORDER BY n DESC/*SkipEND*/
)### t GROUP BY devintf, mac;

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE rpt_tmptbl_2 AS
SELECT devintf, mac FROM ###(
    SELECT concat(interface,'.', devid) AS devintf, mac, count(*) AS n
    FROM $log-event
    WHERE $filter AND logid_to_int(logid) = 26001
    GROUP BY devintf, mac /*SkipSTART*/ORDER BY n DESC/*SkipEND*/
)### t GROUP BY devintf, mac;

SELECT t2.devintf, t2.mac,
       CASE WHEN t1.mac IS NULL THEN 'New' ELSE 'Existing' END AS status
FROM rpt_tmptbl_2 t2
LEFT JOIN rpt_tmptbl_1 t1 ON t2.devintf=t1.devintf AND t2.mac=t1.mac
```

## 18. The `/*fabricStart*/` / `/*fabricEnd*/` Hint

This hint wraps a per-ADOM subquery in SOC/SIEM datasets that need to aggregate across the Fabric (all ADOMs). The FAZ engine replaces the wrapped subquery with a UNION ALL across all ADOM-scoped versions.

```sql
SELECT status, sum(cnt) AS cnt
FROM
  /*fabricStart*/
  (SELECT status, count(*) AS cnt
   FROM $incident
   WHERE $filter-drilldown
   GROUP BY status)
  /*fabricEnd*/
  t
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY status
```

**Rules:**
- Used only in datasets with `log_category: ""` (no log category) that query SOC tables
- The subquery inside the hints accesses ADOM-scoped tables (`$incident`, `$event`, etc.)
- The outer query re-aggregates the UNION ALL result
- Do not use `/*fabricStart*/`/`/*fabricEnd*/` in log-based datasets (`$log-*`) — those are already ADOM-scoped via `$filter`

## Appendix A: Drilldown Queries

> Users cannot create drilldown datasets. This appendix documents the pattern for reference when reading existing built-in datasets that use `$filter-drilldown`.

Drilldown datasets are paired with a parent dataset. When a user clicks a row in a report chart or table, the GUI injects the selected value as `$filter-drilldown` into the drilldown dataset query.

**Key rules:**
1. The inner hcache query **must** carry the drilldown column in its SELECT so the outer query can filter on it.
2. `$filter` goes **inside** the hcache (on raw logs).
3. `$filter-drilldown` goes **outside** the hcache (on the cached result).
4. Dataset names often include `drilldown` or `user-drilldown` to signal this.

```sql
-- Example: clicking a user in a top-users table drills down to their destinations
SELECT
    app, ipstr(dstip) AS dstip,
    sum(sessions) AS sessions,
    sum(bandwidth) AS bandwidth
FROM ###(
    SELECT
        coalesce(nullifna(`user`), nullifna(`unauthuser`), ipstr(`srcip`)) AS user_src,
        app, dstip,
        count(*) AS sessions,
        sum(coalesce(sentbyte,0)+coalesce(rcvdbyte,0)) AS bandwidth
    FROM $log-traffic
    WHERE $filter AND (bitAnd(logflag,1) > 0)
      AND dstip IS NOT NULL
      AND nullifna(app) IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY user_src, app, dstip
    /*SkipSTART*/ORDER BY bandwidth DESC/*SkipEND*/
)### t
WHERE $filter-drilldown    -- GUI injects e.g.: user_src = 'john.smith'
GROUP BY app, dstip
ORDER BY bandwidth DESC
```

**Common mistake — putting `$filter-drilldown` inside the hcache:**
```sql
-- WRONG — the cached result is already filtered and can't be reused for other drilldown values
FROM ###(SELECT ... FROM $log WHERE $filter AND $filter-drilldown ...)### t

-- CORRECT — filter on the outer query only
FROM ###(SELECT ... FROM $log WHERE $filter ...)### t
WHERE $filter-drilldown
```

## Appendix B: Materialized View Queries (`fv_*`)

> Users cannot create custom dashboard views. This appendix documents the `fv_*` materialized view pattern for reference when reading existing built-in dashboard datasets.

Some built-in dashboard datasets read from pre-aggregated materialized views instead of raw logs. These views are maintained automatically by ClickHouse as data is ingested and provide much faster queries for time-series charts.

**View naming:** `fv_{devtype}_{logtype}_{metric}_{interval}_{sp}`
- `devtype`: `fgt`, `ffw`, `fct`, `fpx`, `fwb`, `fml`, `fdd`, `sim`
- `logtype`: `t` (traffic), `e` (event), `X` (SOC/extended)
- `interval`: `5min`, `hour`, `day`
- `sp`: service partition (e.g. `sp1`)
- Examples: `fv_fgt_t_src_dst_5min_sp1`, `fv_ffw_e_ipsec_day_sp1`, `fv_sim_X_sifv_hour_sp1`

**Important:** Views only exist for device types that have sent logs. Always check before relying on them:
```sql
SELECT name FROM system.tables WHERE database='siem' AND name LIKE 'fv_%';
```

**Common columns** (traffic views like `fv_fgt_t_src_dst_*`):

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `timescale` | Pre-bucketed timestamp integer — use `$fv_line_timescale(timescale)` for display |
| `traffic_in` | Bytes received (aggregated) |
| `traffic_out` | Bytes sent (aggregated) |
| `sessions` | Session count |
| `agg_time` | Alternate name for `timescale` in some views |

Use `$fv_line_timescale(timescale)` (not `$flex_timescale`) when reading from these views — the column is already pre-bucketed by the view, not raw `itime`.

```sql
SELECT
    $fv_line_timescale(timescale) AS time,
    sum(traffic_in) AS traffic_in,
    sum(traffic_out) AS traffic_out,
    sum(sessions) AS sessions
FROM (
    (SELECT timescale, sum(traffic_in) AS traffic_in,
            sum(traffic_out) AS traffic_out,
            sum(sessions) AS sessions
     FROM fv_fgt_t_src_dst_5min_sp1
     WHERE $filter
     GROUP BY timescale)
    UNION ALL
    (SELECT timescale, sum(traffic_in) AS traffic_in,
            sum(traffic_out) AS traffic_out,
            sum(sessions) AS sessions
     FROM fv_fgt_t_src_dst_hour_sp1
     WHERE $filter
     GROUP BY timescale)
) combined
GROUP BY time
ORDER BY time
```

Note the UNION ALL pattern combining `5min` and `hour` views — dashboards typically union multiple granularities so the right resolution is used depending on the selected time range.
